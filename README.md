# I learned that git is a distributed software version control system. Basically Git is meant for collaborative projects and 

# allows you to modify files for really any purpose like just testing ideas or working on the implementation of a project

# Whats great with a DSVCS is that multiple people can be working and have a full copy of the repository to modify and maybe

# work on different features for each group member. Still this does not change the main repository until you decide to commit

# the code which helps in preventing bugs from reaching the main repository.

# One thing I was surprised to learn was that Git and Github are different. Github basically integrates very well with Git and 

# uses it as a DVCS for their files, but Github has its own unique features.

# One thing is that Github's entire purpose is to be used for collaborative projects, but also giving opportunities for the 

# Community to peer review and look over your code if thats what you desire.

# Github is a very popular service and has really been taking over the world as more and more people wish to use it
